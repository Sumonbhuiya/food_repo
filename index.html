            <p>There are different types of Food blogging. As long as it is about food it is considered as food blog.
                Most often a food blog has overlapping elements of all or some of these elements. A blog is a personal
                journal and there is no real rule of writing a food blog.</p>

                <p>When I was in college I was a church counselor in Colorado and had my first taste of Mexican food.
                    Recently I've learned to make more authentic dishes like these pork huevos.
